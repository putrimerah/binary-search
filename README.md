# binary-search
Perform a binary search in go

This code is one of my coding practice process that I get from educative.io

The goals is to perform a binary search with a low process inside to pass a big O notation.

# 1 Check the mid of an array
Searching mid of array is on of a challange. To get a mid of an array we have to define high and low limit
```golang
var low int = 0
var high int = len(nums) - 1
```
To get the mid position we can use this formula
```golang
midtmp := (high - low) / 2
```
# 2 Get the target position by mid position that we define previously
Because we want to get the index of a target, we have to get a mid value in a loop
```golang
for low <= high {
    mid := low + (high-low)/2
}
```
with this approach, the mid value will be able to set dynamicaly depend on the next logical approach.
Next are we want to get the index num of a target. The logical implementation will be like this

- If nums[mid] is equal to the target value, we return mid.
- If nums[mid] is greater than target, point high to mid-1, and the value of low remains the same. Now we will search the left part of the array.
- If nums[mid] is less than target, point low to mid + 1, and the value of high remains the same. Now we will search the right part of the array.

```golang
if nums[mid] == target {
    return mid
} else if target < nums[mid] {
    high = mid - 1
} else if target > nums[mid] {
    low = mid + 1
}
```
When the value of low is greater than the value of high, this indicates that the target is not present in the array. This is because weâ€™ve checked all possible positions where target might exist. So, -1 is returned.

Good Luck!
